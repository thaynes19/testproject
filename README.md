# The Cornellian Mobile App

# This app was developed by Sloane Bartleme, Noah Carpenter, Angel Fabila, Tim Haynes, Cole Horner, and Jacob Norris. Jacob Norris 
is also using this project as his capstone piece for his Computer Science Senior Capstone CSC 512. This app was developed for the 
purpose of giving the school newspaper, The Cornellian, an outlet to have their stories published on an app instead of having to 
print the paper necessary for school-wide distribtution. 

Our team used Java with xml files in Android Studio in addition to using the Scrum methodology. We utilized Trello for our Scrum board
which can be seen at the following link: https://trello.com/b/fPF6IOAg
